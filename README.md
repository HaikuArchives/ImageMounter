ImageMounter
============

Mounts filesystem-images by right-clicking. ImageMounter can be used as an add-on or by selecting it as an application out of the Tracker's "Open With..." menu. Supported are BFS, HFS, DOS and ISO9660 images.
If ImageMounter is double-clicked, a small window pops up where you can drop the image file.
